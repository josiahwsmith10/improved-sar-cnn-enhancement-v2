# improved-sar-cnn-enhancement-v2
An early project for using CNN models to enhance radar images. Work from this project was extended for use in several other projects:
- [THz-and-Sub-THz-Imaging-Toolbox](https://github.com/josiahwsmith10/THz-and-Sub-THz-Imaging-Toolbox) for simulating radar images efficiently
- [Radar-Musical-Instrument](https://github.com/josiahwsmith10/Radar-Musical-Instrument) code for the paper "An FCNN-Based Super-Resolution mmWave Radar Framework for Contactless Musical Instrument Interface" ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01995), [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2021.3079695))
- A Vision Transformer Approach for Efficient Near-Field Irregular SAR Super-Resolution ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02074), [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1109/WMCS55582.2022.9866326))
- Efficient CNN-based Super Resolution Algorithms for mmWave Mobile Radar Imaging ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02092), [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP46576.2022.9897190))
- Deep Learning-Based Multiband Signal Fusion for 3-D SAR Super-Resolution ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02017), [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2023.3270111))
- Improved Static Hand Gesture Classification on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks using Novel Sterile Training Technique ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02039), [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3051454))
